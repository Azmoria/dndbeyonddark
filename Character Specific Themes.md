You can create a theme for each character by creating a copy of the theme and applying it to specific characters. 

To do this click on the extension and click manage.

Open the character sheet theme by clicking on it. 

Select everything (CTRL+A on windows computers) and copy it (CTRL+C).

Go back to the manage view by clicking back to manage on the left.

Next click "Write new style" on the left but make sure "as Usercss" is checked beside it like so:

Select all again and paste the original copied theme (CTRL+V)

Scroll down to where it says https[]()://www[]().dndbeyond.com/profile/.*/characters/\\d*

You can delete the other line below by hitting the minus sign.

Replace the first line with the specific url for your character as so:

and again further down as so:

The second line is used for the dice tray popup compainion Javascript. You can find more info here: <a href="https://github.com/Azmoria/dndbeyonddark/blob/master/Dice%20Capture%20README.md">Dice Capture README.md</a>

again you can remove the other lines if you wish they are for dice outside the character sheet.

You will also have to change the name of the file at the very top beside @name before it will let you save it. 
I change this to my character name but you can name it whatever you would like. I also remove the update url to make sure it does not automatically update although I don't think this is required. I do it anyway as I've had them accidently update and have to redo these steps.

Click save on the left.


Go to the character sheet you made the theme for. Click on stylus again. Click the three dots beside the original theme and check Exclude the current URL. This will also exclude the dice tray if you have it installed.

Style the theme you created to your liking and you're done. 

***NOTE:*** Character specific themes will not automatically update as they have manual changes. You can manually update them by forcing the update but it will overide your changes and you will have to repeat the above steps starting with changing the name and replacing the URL.
