This requires the character sheet theme to work. Follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/Azmoria/dndbeyonddark/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> to install that first. The background color is set in this theme at the bottom of the options.

Then you will need an extention that allows you to install user.js.

 I recommend Tampermonkey. You can get it for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/">Firefox</a>

*Note I haven't tested firefox yet.

Then install the js by going <a href="https://github.com/Azmoria/dndbeyonddark/raw/master/Dice%20Tray%20Stream%20Window.user.js">here</a>

It will popup with the below. Click install.

Once installed when you load into various parts of the site where dice are enabled it will pop up another window. If it doesn't make sure you are allowing popups on dndbeyond. You can change the background in the character sheet theme as above. If you do change the background you will have to refresh the original page which will open a new popup. 

The video in the window will initially be paused. Press play.

Pull the dice tray tab into a seperate window. You can put it behind the main window but it will not work in full screen.

After you have pressed play, roll dice in the oringal window and the video will resize to the original windows size. You may have to adjust your dice tray window to fit.

Once you have this set up add the window that starts with "Dice Tray - ..." to your OBS or software of choice.
