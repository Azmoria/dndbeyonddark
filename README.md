# dndbeyonddark
Themes for DNDBeyond allowing for custom colors. Dark theme by default. The character sheet theme will only work with the updated framework and also works for the dice alpha.


You will need Stylus or another User CSS extension to apply these themes. 

You can get Stylus here:

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">For Chrome</a><br>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styl-us/">For Firefox</a> *Note I have not tested this with firefox yet although I plan to it won't be for awhile. 

Once you have Stylus installed click the links below to install the themes. I suggest opening them in a new tab clicking install then closing the tab.

With the exception of the dice roller most of the alpha or beta content has not been themed as I am waiting for finalized versions and they either have their own dark mode available (such as the encounter builder) or are darker than the original site design.

I also probably will not touch the marketplace at all as this is more for everyday use pages.
